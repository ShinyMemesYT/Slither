# Slither
Slither, a remake of the classic game, snake.

To make the exe, run this command(all commands in command prompt): 
`python setup.py build`

If it is not recnognized, use this:
`cd (location of files)`


Then the first command. Any error codes, just google them and it should help. Enjoy!
PS: For the process to work, you will need to download cx_Freeze by downloading it from https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=display&name=cx_Freeze&version=5.0.1
or using the command:
`pip install cx_Freeze`
after using
`cd(location of scripts directory in python)`
